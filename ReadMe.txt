This is a Battleship Clone for Linux users only.
It works in terminal.
It only uses the native c++ library.
It is OOP. However, I made a mistake in putting the main ai
logic in the player.h file. I will move that later.
I used g++, nano, valgrind, and gdb. I basically went commando on this project.
I only other regret is that I didn't allow for the human player to place
their ships manually.

Have fun playing!
